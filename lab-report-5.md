You must run an if statement checking if name is equal to null and throwing either an IllegalArgumentException or printing an error message before the print message!

The bug is that in an attempt to concatenate name with the greeting message, in Java, when you concatenate null with the "+" operator, the null reference is converted to the string "null". The program always assumes that name will hold a valid value. 

# Reflection

In this class I learend how to remotely start a server either on my own local computer or the UCSD computer (ieng6). The use of vim can be very easily used to access around a file that I will be using in my future coding endeavors. I also learned how to write and execute bash scripts that can be used to execute a series of commands. All in all, CSE15L was a fun and interactive class that I will take with me for future classes.
